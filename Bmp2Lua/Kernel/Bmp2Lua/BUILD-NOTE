Dear user,

If you want to build this program by yourself, the following tips are useful.

You need to link these libraries:

* libpng
* zlib(for libpng)
* libjpeg

And I suggest that these Boost libraries should be built first by b2 or bjam, in order to link:

* Filesystem(of course you need system)
* Program_options

The numeric extension for GIL wasn't included in the Boost, so I attached one(it's extremely hard to find!)
Copy the files in the "numeric.zip" under the "boost/gil/extension".

Remember to add the following content to boost/gil/extension/io/png_io_private.hpp, or you will get a error like "¡®int_p_NULL¡¯ was not declared in this scope".

#define png_infopp_NULL (png_infopp)NULL
#define int_p_NULL (int*)NULL
#define png_bytep_NULL (png_bytep)NULL

and change 'png_set_gray_1_2_4_to_8(png_ptr)' to 'png_set_expand_gray_1_2_4_to_8(png_ptr)'

This program used some C++11 features, so MAKE SURE your complier support C++11.

The compliers I use were TDM-GCC 64 4.8.1 and TDM-GCC 32 4.8.1.The Boost I used version is 1.55.0.

Altgough I write this program under windows 8.1 x64 , but I don't use anything rely on specific platform.
